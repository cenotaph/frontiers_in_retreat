/><br
/>Building a theoretical framework in the form of reading group;<br
/>- this is suggested for the smaller group of partner network.<br
/>we can develop a model that can be joined by any of the participants,<br
/>but my suggestion would be to develop specialized reading groups for each of the directions<br
/>Building a dynamic glossary of most important keywords; (thumbs up) (question from Juha: how could others follow up on this process &amp; contribute?)<br
/>Establishing mediation method for the medialab activities 2014 - 2018: documentation and distribution.<br
/><br

/><br
/>1. ADAPTATIONS WORKSHOP, Turku archipelago, Finland 2015 M. August/September<br

/>Presentation of future fictions (written and visual art based) drawing on the two previous workshops and informing the following workshop.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>with MIT students<br

/><br
/><b>Mustarinda</b><br
/><br
/><b>Grad</b><br
/><br
/><b>Farrera</b><br
/>About incubator: Apart other participants, how many artists and managers of centers we have to invite to our incubator? There is a common criterium?<br
/><br
/>(comment from Juha to Jenni (&amp;everyone) - the overlap of GRAD + Farrera incubators, is this a problem? if yes, can the timing be changed for one of the events? should we have a HIAP + GRAD + Farrera skype session to figure this out, if this is not simple to solve?)<br
/><br
/><b>Jutempus</b><br
/><br
/>local partnerships, Finnish partner universities, Fiction ws in Iceland&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><b>Serde&nbsp;</b><br
/><br
/><b>Skaftfell</b><br
/>Can we make a collective Google calender? (sounds good!)<br
/><br
/>(googlecalendar is more flexible, since it can be embedded in people' calendars... but it would be good to use teamwork as the main platform, let's talk about this later on....)<br
/><br
/>(Takk)<br

/><br
/>Come up with suggestions of possible speakers, develop reading library<br
/>It should not necessarily reflect all the needs of all the partners, maybe it could set a model fitting also to other groups.&nbsp;<br
/>How this could be followed? Try to set up a small group during the coming month<br
/>The glossary will be enriched with annotations and more expanded version once we proceed with the reading group and series of lectures in the fall<br
/>Build a pool that can be useful, put things into a dialectical<br
/><br
